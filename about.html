<h2>Our App</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">We at Crafter aim to change the way movies and music are created. We want to make this world more entertaining.
A massive online community of independent filmmakers, music composers, actors, editors etc. use Crafter as a team collaboration app while creating music and movies.
Crafter connects all stakeholders and turns ideas into action through hiring, project scheduling, group conversation, and personalized one on one conversation. Collaborations inspire productivity and in turn stakeholders are more efficient while creating amazing movie and music content.
We do not want artists to only create content we want them to create great entertaining content</p>

<h2>Why we are doing this</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">We picked this idea because we are our customer: young audience who don't want to watch or listen to the most boring content. Who are equally likely to consider a fresh music album or an independent film to watch; who spent awful time searching for most refreshing and entertaining content
The founding team have domain expertise in building technologies; in product development and operations; and in directly engaging with independent film makers ages 20-­35.The response has been unbelievable.</p>
<h2>Recruiting and Onboarding</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">Last month we received over 180 CVs submitted for 3 positions. “We’re both lucky and quite challenged,” our founder Navatej says. The company’s first preference for filling roles is to look inside, and after that to look externally and start with internal recommendations. Every candidate that makes it through to an interview goes through a set of interviews related to their role , and in addition they have two additional interviews related to core values. These are conducted by either by the founders or people selected by the founders about their experience, understanding and mindset related to Crafter.
These interviews focus on our core values to determine how in their life they have lived these values in order to make sure that anyone who comes to Crafter is going to be successful in living these values. One employee says. "It is the one place where our founder Navatej Kumar is comfortable with us being homogenous - everyone should believe in our mission
making the world more entertaining.”
Navatej notes that we are looking for missionaries not mercenaries, and has this advice for would-be applicants: "The minute people start talking about job titles or are more interested in the salary and equity over changing the world more entertaining via building robust technologies, we know that they are probably barking up the wrong tree. We’re very true to our core values in the hiring process."</p>
